# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Network CLI Assistant is a command-line tool that interprets natural language input from users and converts it into structured function calls for common network tasks. The system will execute network operations like SSH commands on remote hosts and generate network configuration rules (such as Cisco ACLs), then provide summarized output with suggested next steps. This tool aims to bridge the gap between human intent and technical network operations, making network administration more accessible and efficient.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to query port status on remote servers using natural language, so that I can quickly check network connectivity without remembering specific command syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs "show me port status on server X" THEN the system SHALL parse the intent and extract the target host
2. WHEN the system identifies a port status query THEN it SHALL generate a structured function call to run_command with appropriate netstat parameters
3. WHEN the SSH command executes successfully THEN the system SHALL return formatted port information
4. IF the SSH connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and suggest troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to generate Cisco ACL rules using natural language commands, so that I can quickly create access control policies without manual rule syntax construction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs "block IP Y from reaching server X" THEN the system SHALL parse source IP, destination IP, and action intent
2. WHEN the system identifies an ACL generation request THEN it SHALL call generate_acl function with appropriate parameters
3. WHEN ACL generation completes THEN the system SHALL return valid Cisco ACL syntax
4. IF invalid IP addresses are provided THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and request correction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network operator, I want the system to validate all generated configurations and commands, so that I can trust the output for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any function generates network configuration THEN the system SHALL validate syntax before returning results
2. WHEN SSH commands are constructed THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN IP addresses are processed THEN the system SHALL validate format and ranges
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and correction guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with varying technical expertise, I want clear output summaries and next-step suggestions, so that I can understand results and know what actions to take next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any function executes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide a human-readable summary of results
2. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant follow-up actions
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL explain the issue in plain language
4. IF ambiguous input is received THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure handling of credentials and sensitive information, so that network access remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSH connections are established THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication methods
2. WHEN credentials are required THEN the system SHALL prompt for input without storing sensitive data
3. WHEN configuration files are accessed THEN the system SHALL read from environment variables or secure vaults
4. IF sensitive information appears in logs THEN the system SHALL redact or exclude it from output

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer extending the system, I want a modular architecture that supports adding new network functions, so that the tool can grow with organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new network functions are added THEN the system SHALL integrate them without modifying core parsing logic
2. WHEN function signatures are defined THEN they SHALL follow consistent input/output patterns
3. WHEN the system processes natural language THEN it SHALL use extensible intent recognition
4. IF new command types are introduced THEN the system SHALL handle them through the same dispatcher mechanism
